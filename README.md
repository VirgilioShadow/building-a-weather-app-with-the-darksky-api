Building for the web is just about as much fun as anyone can have, especially when you’re working with an API to dynamically pull in data. Some might call this building “web apps”, others may call it building “web pages”. Whatever the case we’re going to build a demo to display a weather forecast using the DarkSky and Google Maps API, JavaScript magic and CSS animations. It’s a ton of fun so let’s get started!

**Note:** we won’t be going into the minutiae of the build process, but you’ll have enough information from this overview to go and build something yourself.
